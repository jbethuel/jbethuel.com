January feels excruciatingly long, especially coming after the holiday season. 
This year, I had the opportunity to start late, beginning on the 8th, since I had a few unused days off from last year.
I had a whole week to myself to get things in order.

Here are my thoughts;

• Thrive - surviving is not enough. We need to thrive in all aspects of life. Especially in tech(my career) where it always move forward, the grind of trying to learn everything as much as possible.

• Experiences over things - Memories last forever, while things are just temporary. Make sure to capture photos!

• Health is wealth - How can you enjoy life when you are not 100%? 

I have been mindful of the foods I consume and have been exercising 5 times a week!

• Mindfulness - being aware of the present. I tend to overthink, especially about the future. Be mindful of the media you consume and avoid mindless scrolling or brainrot!

• Sunlight - As soon as you wake up, absorb sunlight immediately. Been listening to Huberman Labs podcasts lately on how to improve health in general.

• Write - I am ashamed to admit that I haven't taken a note physically (with a pen) for a while now. This includes blog posts, which you are reading now! Will push myself to take notes more!

• Read - it will keep me away from my phone. Read more books!

Hopefully, February will be more exciting. See you in the next blog post, ciao!
