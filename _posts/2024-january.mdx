January feels excruciatingly long, especially coming after the holiday season. 
This year, I had the opportunity to start late, beginning on the 8th, since I had a few unused days off from last year.
I had a whole week to myself to get things in order.

Here are my thoughts;

• Thrive - surviving is not enough. We need to thrive in all aspects of life.

• Experiences over things - Memories last forever, while things are just temporary. Make sure to capture photos!

• Health is wealth - How can you enjoy life when you are not 100%? 

I have been mindful of the foods I consume and have been exercising 5 times a week!

• Mindfulness - being aware of the present. I tend to overthink, especially about the future. Be mindful of the media you consume and avoid mindless scrolling!

• Sunlight - As soon as you wake up, absorb sunlight immediately. Free natural vitamins!

• Write - I am ashamed to admit that I haven't taken a note physically (with a pen) for a while now. Will push myself to take notes more!

• Read - it will keep me away from my phone. Read more books!

Hopefully, February will be more exciting. See you in the next blog post, ciao!
