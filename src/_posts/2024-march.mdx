March has been spoiling me a lot of science fiction stuff (which I really like). First is 
I finished a book called Project Hail Mary which was about a guy who had no recollection
or memory of his life. He woke up in a strange facility with 2 dead bodies and a robotic arm
that would respond to his request. As it progress, he found out that he was experiencing
1.5 earth gravity. I found this book from goodreads as it was the top rated book for scifi
in 2021. Would like to add that it is the same author from 'The Martian'. A known fact from
that book(which was also adapted in film) was it is science accurate. This means that if it
ever happen in real life, it would be possible.

Second would be Dune Part Two. I never watched the 1984 film so I have nothing to compare it
from. I had been a fan of Denis Villeneuve(director) since I watched his adaptation of famous
scifi film called Blade Runner 2049 (got interested of this film because Arctic Monkeys referenced
the film in their song called Star Treatment from their Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino record,
which I really love despite mixed review from fans). Would also like to add that the score composer
was Hans Zimmer, the guy who made soundtrack from films like Interstellar and Inception. The film
was so good and I would upset if they will not win any Oscar in 2025.

Took me time write this post. As I was having a hard time what to write but glad I had something
came out eventually. See you next post! Ciao
