Went to Singapore last February. We chose Singapore because I deemed it to be the most tourist-friendly city in Asia since we are first-timers, although it was not that wallet friendly.
As a first-time traveler abroad, we were very stoked and at the same time anxious.
We were actually very lucky that it was the driest month of the year, so we were able to explore the city bearable.
And also we went before the Eras Tour of Taylor Swift, so we were able to avoid the crowd and the concert goers.

Bit anxious and nervous before and during the immigration interview.

Philippine Airlines served delicious food and the flight was smooth and it was on time!

Changi Airport is the best airport in the world. It was so clean and organized. It was so big that we got lost a few times.
